### For-loops

A Python **for-loop** repeats a block of code some of number of times. For
example:

```python
n = input('How many "hello"s do you want? ')
n = int(n)

for i in range(n):
    print(f'{i+1}. hello')
```

For example:

```
How many "hello"s do you want? 4
1. hello
2. hello
3. hello
4. hello
```

It can also be used to go through the items on a list:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']

for c in colors:
    print(f'{c} is a nice color')
```

For example: 

```
red is a nice color
green is a nice color
yellow is a nice color
orange is a nice color
```

You can combine the above two styles:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']

i = 0
for c in colors:
    print(f'{i+1}. {c} is a nice color')
    i += 1
```

For example:

```python
1. red is a nice color
2. green is a nice color
3. yellow is a nice color
4. orange is a nice color
```

**Optional aside** This last style of for-loop is so common that Python
provides special syntax to handle it:

```python
> colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']

for i, c in enumerate(colors):
    print(f'{i+1}. {c} is a nice color')
```

The output is the same as the previous example:

```python
1. red is a nice color
2. green is a nice color
3. yellow is a nice color
4. orange is a nice color
```

### while Loops

A Python **while-loop** repeats a block of code as long as some given
condition is `True`. For example, this prints the numbers from 1 to 5:

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:    # while-loop header
    print(i+1)  # while-loop body is indented under the header
    i += 1

print('Go!')
```

This prints:

```
1
2
3
4
5
Go!
```

`i < 5` is called the **while-loop condition**, or **condition** for short. A
while-loop condition should always be a boolean expression (i.e. and
expression that returns `True` or `False`).

In general, a while-loop runs like this:

- If the condition is `True`, the statements in the while-loop body are
  executed, one after the other.
- Next, the while-loop condition is evaluated again. If it's `True`, the loop
  body is run again. If it's `False`, Python immediately jumps to the first
  statement *after* the while loop.

After a while-loop body is executed, the condition is evaluated to see if the
body should be executed again.

**Example.** Here's a variation of the above while-loop:

```python
i = 1          # i is initialized to 1 (not 0)
while i <= 5:  # <= is used, not <
    print(i)   # just i, not i + 1
    i += 1

print('Go!')
```

It prints the same thing as before:

```
1
2
3
4
5
Go!
```

In the program, time `i` is initialized to 1 instead of 0, and the condition
uses `<=` instead of `<`.

**Question** What's printed if the statement s`print(i)` and `i += 1` are
swapped?


**Example.** This while-loop counts *down* from 5 to 1:

```python
i = 5
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1     # -= means "subtract from", i.e. subtract 1 from i

print('Blast off!')
```

This prints:

```
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```

**Example.** This while-loop sums the numbers from 1 to 100:

```python
total = 0
i = 1
while i <= 100:
    total += i
    i += 1

print(total)
```

**Aside** If you replace `+=` with `*=`, it prints 100 factorial, i.e. 
`1 * 2 * 3 * ... * 100`.

**Example.** How can you use a while-loop to print just the multiples of 5
from 1 to 100:

```python
i = 5            # i is initialized to 5
while i <= 100:
    print(i)
    i += 5       # i is incremented by 5
```

This prints:

```
5
10
15
20
25
30
35
40
45
50
55
60
65
70
75
80
85
90
95
100
```


### A Basic while-loop Pattern

Many (not not all!) while-loops follow this basic pattern:

```
initialization_statement   # before the while-loop header

while <some-condition>:
    statement_1
    statement_2
    statement_3
    # ...

    increment_statement    # last statement of the body
```

Typically, before a while-loop header, one or more **loop-control variables**
are initialized. For instance, a common initialization statement is `i = 0`.

The loop condition typically checks the value of the loop control variables.

The last statement of a while-loop body is often an increment statement that
increments (or decrements, if the loop is counting down) the variable from the
initialization statement.

In general, this a good pattern to try to follow whenever you are writing a
while-loop.


### Infinite Loops

You can use a while-loop to make an **infinite-loop**, i.e. a loop that never
ends. For example, this prints "hello!" forever:

```python
while True:          # infinite loop
    print('hello!')
```

This loop prints numbers forever:

```python
i = 1
while True:   # infinite loop
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Infinite loops are often a sign of a bug in your program. For instance, it is
easy to forget the increment statement in a while-loop body, resulting in an
infinite loop:

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i+1)
               # oops: forgot i += 1, infinite loop!

print('Go!')   # never printed
```

**Example** Here is an example of a function that may, or may not, loop
forever --- no one knows!

```python
def collatz_step(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:       # is n even?
        return n // 2
    else:                # is n odd?
        return 3 * n + 1

def collatz(n):
    """Repeatedly applies collatz_step to n until it reaches 1.
    Fact: No one knows if there is some positive integer value for n
    that causes this function to loop forever.
    """
    original_n = n
    step_count = 0
    while n > 1:
        #print(n)
        n = collatz_step(n)
        step_count += 1
    #print(n)
    print(f'{step_count} steps to reduce {original_n} to 1')
```

The [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
says that for all positive integers `n`, `collatz(n)` prints 1. Another way of
stating this conjecture is that there is *no* positive integer `n` that causes
`collatz(n)` to loop forever.

Despite being
so simple to state, currently no one knows if the conjecture is true or false.
It is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

Computers have checked that `collatz(n)` prints 1 for all values of `n` up to
$2^{68}$. So if there is a number that makes

The [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
isn't very practical. But it's a nice example that even short and
simple-looking programs can behave in ways that we don't completely
understand.
