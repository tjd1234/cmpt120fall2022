# Lecture 13 Notes

This lecture develops a turtle graphics program that does a random walk:

- [rand_walk1.py](rand_walk1.py), a basic random walk that disappears when it
  goes off the screen
- [rand_walk2.py](rand_walk2.py), a modification of the previous program that
  moves the turtle back to the center whenever it hits an edge
- [rand_walk3.py](rand_walk3.py), a modification of the previous program that
  has the turtle "wrap around" to the opposite side of the screen when it hits
  an edge
