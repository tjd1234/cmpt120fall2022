## If-statements

**If-statements** are the main way of making decisions in Python and they come
in a few different styles. For example:

```python
name = input('Who are you? ')
if name == 'Joe':
	print('Good day Mr President')

print('...')
```

The line `if name == 'Joe'` is the first line of an if-statement. It starts
with the keyword `if`, followed by any boolean expression (i.e. an expression
that evaluates to true or false), followed by a `:` that marks the end of the
line. The code indented underneath is the body of the if-statement, and will
only be executed if the boolean expression evaluates to `True`. If it
evaluates to `False`, then the if-statement body is skipped.

An if-statement can also have an `else`:

```python
name = input('Who are you? ')
if name == 'Joe':
	print('Good day Mr President')
else:
	print('Hey, you\'re not the president!')

print('...')
```

The code indented under the `else` part of an if-statement is only executed if
none of the previous if-statement expressions evaluate to `True`. It's a
catch-all for if-statements.

Here's another example. Imagine a website ask you to enter your password
twice, to confirm it:

```python
pass1 = input('Please enter your password: ')
pass2 = input('Please re-enter your password: ')

if pass1 == pass2:
	print('Okay, the passwords match')
else:
	print("Uh oh, the passwords don't match")
```

You could also have written it this way:

```python
pass1 = input('Please enter your password: ')
pass2 = input('Please re-enter your password: ')

if pass1 != pass2:
	print("Uh oh, the passwords don't match")
else:
	print('Okay, the passwords match')
```

In general, and if-else statement has this form:

```python
if <condition> :
	# ... code to run if condition is true ...
else:
	# ... code to run if condition is false ...
```

The boolean expression being tested is often called the if-statement's
**condition**.


## elif statements

An if-statement can check multiple conditions. For example, suppose a school
with 3 semesters uses a code `s1` for the spring semester, `s2` for the summer
semester, and `s3` for the fall semester:

```python
code = input('Please enter semester code: ')

if code == 's1':      # condition 1
	print('Spring!')
elif code == 's2':    # condition 2
	print('Summer!')
elif code == 's3':    # condition 3
	print('Fall!')
else:
	print('Unknown semester code:', code)
```

This if-statement has 3 conditions. Python checks them one at time, in order
from top to bottom. The first condition that is `True`, Python runs the
indented code underneath and then jumps out of the if-statement. If none of
the conditions are true, the code in the `else` part is executed.

Exactly one of the blocks of indented code in this if-statement are executed.

**Example**: Transit Fares

The city bus system has these rules for fares:

- Children 12 and under ride *free*.
- Youths 14 to 18, or seniors 65 and older, pay *concession* fares.
- Everyone else pays *full* fares.

Write a program that asks a user to enter their age, and then uses an
if-elif-else statement to print the correct fare. If the user enters an age
less than 0, then print a helpful error message.

Here are a few sample runs:

```
How old are you? 66
Senior: concession fare

How old are you? 16
Youth: concession fare

How old are you? 6
Child: free

How old are you? -6
-6 is not a valid age

```

Here's one possible answer (see [bus1.py](bus1.py)):

```python
age = input('How old are you? ')
age = int(age)

if age < 0:
    print(f"{age} is not a valid age!")
elif age <= 12:
    print('Child: free')
elif age <= 18:
    print('Youth: concession fare')
elif age >= 65:
    print('Senior: concession fare')
else:
    print('Adult: full fare')
```

This solution has a readability issue: the statement `elif age <= 18` on its
own suggests that the rule is "if age is less than or equal to 18, then it's a
youth concession fare". But that's not correct. You need to know the two cases
that come before it to understand what it means.

Here is an alternative solution that makes the rules a little more explicit
(see [bus2.py](bus2.py)):

```python
age = input('How old are you? ')
age = int(age)

if age < 0:
    print(f"{age} is not a valid age!")
elif 0 <= age <= 12:
    print('Child: free')
elif 14 <= age <= 18:
    print('Youth: concession fare')
elif 65 <= age:
    print('Senior: concession fare')
else:
    print('Adult: full fare')
```

Now the condition for a youth concession fare is precise, `elif 14 <= age <=
18`.
