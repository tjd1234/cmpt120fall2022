## Spirals

How would you use turtle graphics to draw a spiral? There are at least two
kinds: square, and curvy. Write Python programs to draw both.

### Challenge 1

Draw a *square spiral*.


### Challenge 2

Draw a more curvy-looking spiral.


## Random Walks

A [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) is when the turtle
moves around the screen in a random-seeming way. There are a number of
different ways to do this.


### Challenge 3

Make the turtle do a curvy-looking random walk.


### Challenge 4

Make the turtle do a more rectangular-looking random walk, i.e. turns are
only left or right 90 degrees.


### Challenge 5

When the turtle finishes it's random walk, print out the straight-line
distance from it's starting point of (0, 0) in the center of the screen to the point
where it stops.

You can get (x, y)-position of the turtle using the functions `turtle.xcor()`
and `turtle.ycor()`.

The distance from point $$(0, 0)$$ to point $$(x, y)$$ is $$\sqrt{x^2 +
y^2}$$.
