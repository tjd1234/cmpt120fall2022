## Review

All the course topics are listed on the [index page for this
site](https://tjd1234.github.io/cmpt120fall2022/).

How should you study computer science and programming? Here is a suggestion:

- make a list of [all the topics](https://tjd1234.github.io/cmpt120fall2022/)
- for each topic, write one or two key examples of code that explain it
- also, write down the definition of each technical term ([the textbook includes a glossary of many technical terms at the end of each chapter](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/120fall2022surrey/index.html))
- [do the practice questions listed at the top of the topics page](https://tjd1234.github.io/cmpt120fall2022/)
- create your own practice questions by making variations of questions from the
  notes/textbook

## Practice Quiz

We also did this [practice quiz](finalPracticeQuestions.pdf)
([solutions](finalPracticeQuestions_sol.pdf)) during class.
[import_sort.py](import_sort.py) and [string_sort.py](string_sort.py) contain
some sample code.
