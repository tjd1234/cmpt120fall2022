# CMPT 120 Surrey, Fall 2022

Due dates, marks, discussions, etc. are all on
[Canvas](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/73212).

I recommend you use [the Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/) to run your
Python programs. It's easy to use, and comes complete with all the libraries
you'll need for this course.
